## Mental Health Predictor
Mental Health Predictor is a web application designed to predict whether a person is at risk of depression based on various personal and lifestyle factors. The app uses a machine learning model trained on over 100,000 data points to assess mental health and provides insights based on user input.

Features
Depression Risk Prediction: The app predicts whether a user is at risk of depression based on input data such as age, sleep duration, work pressure, etc.
Interactive Input: Users can adjust input values like age, work pressure, family history, and more using interactive sliders and selectboxes.
Probability Display: The app displays the probability of depression based on the userâ€™s inputs.
Visualization: Users can visualize how different factors affect mental health through interactive charts.
Customizable Inputs: Various input fields (sliders, dropdowns) allow users to personalize the data they enter for predictions.
Requirements
To run this app, you'll need the following Python packages:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
pickle
matplotlib
scikit-learn (for model training)
Installation
Clone this repository or download the files.

Install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the provided link in your web browser to use the app.

How It Works
Data Input: Users are asked to provide details such as their age, profession, sleep hours, and work pressure using interactive sliders and dropdown menus.
Prediction Model: The app uses a trained machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the likelihood of depression based on the input data.
Output: The app shows whether the user is at risk of depression and provides the probability score.
Visualization: The app visualizes the relationship between input factors and mental health using interactive plots.
